## Debugging `gamma_jackknife()`

Material is based on [Chris's tutorial on debugging](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-R-debugging) along with an example.

Let's walk through the debugging procedure of the function `gamma_jackknife()` in `debuggingJackKnifeEst.R`.

## A More Involved Example: `logitBoot()`

  - Load `data.csv`
  - Fit a logistic regression model `y~x` called `mod` in the script provided.
  - What is the std of the coefficient of `x` from `summary(mod)`?
  - Now find the estimate of the same parameter now using bootstrap by simply calling `logitBoot()` as provided in the script.
  - Why is this estimate so much larger?
  - Use debugging tools to figure out the bug.
