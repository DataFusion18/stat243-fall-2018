```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Another code review, this time with PS3, in
particular problem 2 and (if time) problem 3.

Some things to discuss:

  - How they organized the processing in terms of functions.
  - What kind of data structures they used (lists, nested lists,
    character vectors, etc.)
  - What were tricky issues in terms of how the text was formatted that
    they needed to deal with and issues they might not have seen (e.g.,
    how to split sentences on, how to split into chunks)
  - what assertions/testing they used
  - (problem 3) the people in a pair can compare the different OOP
    strategies they used and try to come up with a consensus approach
