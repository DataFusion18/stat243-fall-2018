# Discuss Lo et al. which was assigned for PS6, problem 1. 

The goal would be to have a discussion of how Lo et al. set up the simulation studies and gather thoughts on ways to improve the simulation study. Start by discussing your PS answers in a small group and then we'll have a class discussion. E.g. trying to list on the board:

  - what aspects of a dataset would make it easy/hard to distinguish the null and alternative
  - different ways one could simulate data to assess the effectiveness of the test
  - what scenarios the authors didn't consider that might be important in real life
