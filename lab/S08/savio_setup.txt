Important: assignment to be completed before Tuesday 10/17 section

All, as I've mentioned, we'll be using the campus Savio cluster to do some parallel computing and computing with Spark.

Section on Tuesday will be devoted to getting everyone up to speed on using the cluster.

Before you come to section on Tuesday it's important that you set things up so you can login to Savio. This should take you 10-20 minutes.

1) First, find your username in this Google spreadsheet:

(TBD)

1a) You should have already signed the user agreement. If you haven't (as indicated in the spreadsheet), do it now. 

2) Then follow these instructions to set things up so you can login to Savio using Savio's one-time password system. This will involve setting up the Google authenticator app on your smartphone. If you don't have access to a smartphone, there is an alternative that sets up the Authy app on your laptop.
