## Software

The `howtos` directory has information on installing and/or getting access to the software you'll need for the course. In particular, in the first week of class you'll need to get access to the UNIX command line in some fashion. See https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2018/blob/master/howtos/accessingUnixCommandline.md for some options on how to do this. 

One way to get access to the software is to get an SCF account as follows:

  - If you are a Statistics graduate student, request an account [here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/accounts)
  - If you are not affiliated with Statistics, get a paper form from Chris (if you are not a Statistics grad student).

## Submitting assignments

The file https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2018/blob/master/howtos/submitting-electronically.txt [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] has information on setting up a Github repository for the class and submitting your assignments by committing your solution to Github. We'll discuss this in section on Tuesday August 28.

## Online discussion and questions.

We will use the [course Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/calgroups.berkeley.edu/d/forum/stat-classes-2188-stat-243-all) for communication (announcements, questions, and discussion). You can post and view through the browser interface or you can email the group at stat-classes-2188-stat-243-all@calgroups.berkeley.edu. If you're enrolled in the class you should be a member of the group and be able to access it. If you're auditing or not yet enrolled and would like access, email Chris.
